The best one we have is the 69 MHz one (10 arcsec beam and 26k
components) that we made with Reinout in 2011. I have a BBS and NDPPP
version and a casa .model image. This model does not contain spectral
information and has been arbitraritly rescaled to 30 kJy. Let me know
whether you think this will be useful for you.
